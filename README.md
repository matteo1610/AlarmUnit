# Alarm Control Unit

A home alarm system implemented with an Arduino Nano microcontroller. The project simulates interactions between PIR motion sensors, magnetic switches, LEDs, and a buzzer to detect intrusions, door/window openings, and suspicious movements.

## Key Features

- Detection via PIR sensors and simulated magnetic switches
- Violation classification on three levels:
  - Minor disturbance
  - Door/window left open
  - Confirmed intrusion
- Event-driven logic using interrupts and hardware timers
- Visual and acoustic alerts through LEDs and buzzer
